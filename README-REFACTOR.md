# SyncBeats - Refactored Modular Architecture

## Overview
The SyncBeats application has been refactored into a clean, modular architecture that separates client and server concerns for better maintainability and readability.

## Project Structure

## Architecture Benefits

### Client-Side Modularization
- **SyncBeatsApp**: Main application coordinator
- **AudioManager**: Handles all audio playback, synchronization, and control
- **PlaylistManager**: Manages playlist operations and file uploads
- **RoomManager**: Handles room joining, leaving, and state synchronization
- **SocketManager**: Centralizes all Socket.IO event handling
- **UIManager**: Manages DOM updates and user interface interactions
- **YouTubeManager**: Handles YouTube search and integration
- **SharingManager**: Manages social sharing features

### Server-Side Modularization
- **SyncBeatsServer**: Main server application class
- **SocketHandler**: Centralized Socket.IO event processing
- **RoomManager**: Server-side room state management
- **YouTubeService**: YouTube API integration and video processing
- **FileUploadService**: File upload and storage management
- **Routes**: Clean API endpoint definitions

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### 2. Better Error Handling
Modular structure allows for more targeted error handling and debugging.

### 3. Improved Testability
Individual modules can be tested in isolation, improving code quality.

### 4. Enhanced Readability
Code is organized logically, making it easier for developers to find and modify specific functionality.

### 5. Scalability
New features can be added as new modules without affecting existing code.

## Running the Application

### Using the New Modular Server
```bash
npm run start-new    # Production
npm run dev-new      # Development with auto-restart
```

### Using the Original Server (Legacy)
```bash
npm start           # Production
npm run dev         # Development with auto-restart
```

### Building the Client
```bash
npm run build       # Production build
npm run dev-build   # Development build with watch
```

## Migration Notes

### Client-Side Changes
- The monolithic `SyncBeats` class has been split into focused service modules
- All functionality remains the same, but is now better organized
- The global `syncBeats` instance is still available for backward compatibility

### Server-Side Changes
- Socket.IO event handling is now centralized in `SocketHandler`
- Room management is extracted into a dedicated `RoomManager` service
- API routes are cleanly separated from business logic
- File upload logic is encapsulated in `FileUploadService`

### Backward Compatibility
- The original `server.js` remains functional for comparison
- All existing API endpoints work identically
- Client functionality is preserved exactly

## Development Workflow

1. **Client Development**: Modify files in `src/client/` and run `npm run dev-build`
2. **Server Development**: Modify files in `src/server/` and run `npm run dev-new`
3. **Adding Features**: Create new service modules following the established patterns
4. **Testing**: Each module can be tested independently

## Future Enhancements

The modular structure makes it easy to add:
- Unit tests for individual modules
- Additional audio sources (Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.)
- Advanced room features (permissions, moderation)
- Real-time chat functionality
- Mobile app support
- Performance monitoring and analytics

This refactored architecture provides a solid foundation for future development while maintaining all existing functionality.
